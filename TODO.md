* @nick is afk -> ignore awesomes from that nick until they say something
* we could also program a "chaos song of the week" that boots everyone off stage when it plays
  pick a song at random from recent history, maybe with a playcount > 2 threshhold
* Need to figure out if I can tell if a user is TT Gold or not, so we can alter behavior
  based on that.
